# Clean Architecture

![arch](CleanArchitecture.jpg)

The further in you go, the **higher level** the software becomes. The outer circles are **mechanisms**. The inner circles are **policies**.

## The Dependency Rule
This rule says that source code dependencies **can only point inwards.**

**We donâ€™t want anything in an outer circle to impact the inner circles.**

What if an inner layer needs to use a concept implemented in an outer layer? Then we **declare an interface in the inner layer** (see [DIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)).

## Example
Let's download an example:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/bmf-san/go-clean-architecture-web-application-boilerplate
```

Let's go inside the `app` folder.

All layer-related code is inside the same folder, as follows:

| Layer | Folder |
|-------|--------|
| Frameworks & Drivers | infrastructure |
| Interface Adapters | interfaces |
| Use Cases | usecases |
| Entities | domain |

### Layers Interaction

```puml
@startuml


package domain {
    [User]
}

package usecases {
    interface UserRepository as iurepo
    [UserInteractor] ..> iurepo 
    interface Logger as ilog
    [UserInteractor] ..> [User] 
}

package interfaces {
    [UserRepository] --> iurepo 
    interface SQLHandler as isql
    [UserRepository] ..> isql 
    [UserController] ..> [UserInteractor] 
    [UserController] ..> ilog 
}

package infrastructure {
    [Logger] --> ilog 
    [SQLHandler] --> isql 
    node router
    router ..> [UserController] 
    router ..> ilog 
    router ..> isql 
}


@enduml
```

#### Legend

```puml
@startuml

package folder {
    interface "Another Interface" as ai

    [Class] --> Interface : implements
    [Class] ..> [Another Class] : uses
    [Class] ..> ai : uses
    node "non-class concept"
} 


@enduml
```

### Sequence Diagram

```puml
@startuml

main.go -> infrastructure : give me a new logger
infrastructure -> infrastructure : resolve implementation of Logger interface
infrastructure --> main.go : take logger hidden by the interface

main.go -> infrastructure : give me a new SQL handler
infrastructure -> infrastructure : resolve implementation of SQLHandler interface
infrastructure --> main.go : take SQL handler hidden by the interface

main.go -> infrastructure : set and handle endpoints
